# Security Policy

## Scope

This project ships **Myco** — a native macOS menu-bar app — plus its internal,
pure-standard-library Python engine (`engine/distribute.py` and the `chatsync`
readers) that copies skill folders into per-agent directories and read-only
aggregates local chat history. It runs locally, has no network calls, and stores
no secrets. The realistic risk surface is small, but reports are still welcome.

## Supported versions

The latest release on the `master` branch is the only supported version.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest (`master`) | ✅ |
| older tags | ❌ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security problems.

Instead, use GitHub's private reporting:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability** (Private vulnerability reporting).
3. Describe the issue, affected file(s), and reproduction steps.

If private reporting is unavailable, you may open a minimal issue asking a
maintainer to reach out, without disclosing details publicly.

## What to expect

- An acknowledgement, typically within a few days.
- An assessment of severity and, if valid, a fix in a subsequent release.
- Credit in the release notes if you'd like it.
