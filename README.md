If you run more than one AI coding tool on the same project — say **Claude Code**,
**Codex CLI**, and **Cursor** — you've probably hit this wall:

- You install a skill and only *one* tool can find it.
- You try `/design` in Codex like you do in Claude Code, and nothing happens.
- You put the skill in `~/.claude/skills/`, switch machines, and it's gone.

The uncomfortable truth: **there is no shared skills directory across agents.**
"Install once, everything sees it" is literally false. Each product reads skills
from a *different* directory, and each has a *different* invocation syntax.

This repo is a portable **`SKILL.md`** (plus a helper script) that encodes the
correct way to make a skill genuinely shared and switchable across tools:

1. Install it into **per-agent directories inside the repository**, so it
   travels with Git.
2. Document the **per-tool invocation syntax** so people actually use it right.

---

## Why it's tricky (the 30-second version)

| Agent | Repo-level dir (travels with Git) | How you invoke it |
|-------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/skills/` | mention the skill by name (some suites add `/slash`) |
| **Codex CLI** | `.agents/skills/` and/or `.codex/skills/` | `$skill-name`, `/skills`, or name it — **not** `/design` |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/` (rules format) | rules auto-inject; also tolerates `.agents/` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.agents/skills/` | name it in the prompt |
| **Cline** | `.cline/skills/`, `.clinerules/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/` | name it (experimental toggle) |

> 💡 `.agents/` is emerging as the **cross-agent standard** repo path — Codex,
> Gemini CLI, and Cursor all accept it. If you can only keep one path, that's
> the safest bet.

## Install *this* skill (self-demonstrating)

This skill practises what it preaches — here's how to make it available to your
own agents.

### Option A — one agent, quick try

Copy the skill folder into whichever agent you use:

```bash
# Claude Code (user-level)
cp -R skill/multi-agent-skill-sharing ~/.claude/skills/

# Codex CLI (user-level)
cp -R skill/multi-agent-skill-sharing ~/.codex/skills/
```

### Option B — share it across all agents on a project (recommended)

From inside your target project, run the bundled distributor. It fans the skill
out into every agent's repo-level directory and is cross-platform:

```bash
# from your project root
python3 /path/to/multi-agent-skill-sharing/scripts/distribute.py \
  --src /path/to/multi-agent-skill-sharing/skill \
  --dest .
```

Then commit the new `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.codex/skills`
directories so the skill travels with Git.

See [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) for per-tool details and Windows steps.

## How to use it, once installed

Just describe your situation to your agent, e.g.:

> "I use Codex and Claude Code on this repo — make this skill usable in both."

or ask it the question that triggers the skill:

> "Why can only Claude Code use this skill?"

The skill walks the agent through detecting your tools, distributing the skill
into the right directories, writing routing notes into `AGENTS.md`, and
reminding you to commit.

## Caveat

Skill-discovery conventions across these tools **change quickly**. The paths
here were verified **2026-07**. If a path doesn't resolve, check the tool's own
docs — and PRs to keep the table current are very welcome.
